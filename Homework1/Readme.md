- **What is the effect of the Ks and Kd parameters on the jello?**
....

- **What are the benefits and the drawbacks of the collision system used here? What are some different ways in which it could be improved?**
....

- **What are some example systems you could model with Mass-spring simulations? Explain how you would you construct the model.**
...

- **Does the jello behave realistically? What integration method did you choose to make the Jello stable?**
...

- **How would you model and simulate water (in terms of a continuous simulation)?**
...
