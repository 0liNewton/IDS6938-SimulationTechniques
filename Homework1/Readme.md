#Homework 1 : The Jello Cube 
##Continuous Simulation Assignment
## IDS6938-Simulation Techniques - [University of Central Florida](http://www.ist.ucf.edu/grad/)
## Olivia Newton

What is the effect of the Ks and Kd parameters on the jello? .

What are the benefits and the drawbacks of the collision system used here? What are some
different ways in which it could be improved? .

What are some example systems you could model with Mass-spring simulations? Explain
how you would you construct the model.

Does the jello behave realistically? What integration method did you choose to make the
Jello stable?

How would you model and simulate water (in terms of a continuous simulation)?
