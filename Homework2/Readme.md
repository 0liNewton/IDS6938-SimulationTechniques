## Part 1: Empirical Tests of Randomness (20 pts).
###### Step A
- Random number engines: Mersenne Twister, Knuth-B, Minimal Standard, Ranlux, and Sobol
- Raw output of the engines is stored in file *HW2_Part1_StepA.xlsx* (raw results sheet) in the Homework 2 folder
- Descriptive statistics for each engine are provided in table 1

| Table 1. Descriptive Statistics |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table1.PNG?raw=true)  |

- Random number engine ouput included aggregated data, specifically counts of the discrete values generated by each engine
- This frequency data was used to construct histograms with x-axis bins in incremements of 10 (figures 1 and 2)
-- Incremements of 10 was a relatively arbitrary choice. The incremement amount used for the bins was inconsequential to the shape of the histogram as illustrated in figure 3.
- Looking at the histograms we can see that all of the values were (for the most part) equally, or **uniformly**, sampled

- Spearman's correlation was run to assess the relationship between the engines' raw output
- Very weak correlation between each engine output (e.g., Mersenne & Minimal Standard, *r*~s~ = -.003,) and they failed to reach significance...
- ...except for one of the correlations...accidentally included output from a sixth random number engine, default random engine, in my analyses
-- Weak negative correlation between Ranlux and Default was statistically significant (*r*~s~ = -.008, *p* = .008)

| Table 2. Spearman's Correlation |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table2.PNG?raw=true)  |

- Ran two one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to assess the distribution of each engine output
- Looking at the last row of table 3, the p-value for each engine is significant
-- The engine outputs **do not** have an approximate normal distribution (Lee, Famoye, Shelden, & Brown, n.d.)

| Table 3. Testing for Distribution - Normal Distribution |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table3.PNG?raw=true)  |

- Conversely, the p-values in the uniform distribution table fail to reach significance
-- So we **can not** say that the data **does not** have a uniform distribution

| Table 4. Testing for Distribution - Uniform Distribution |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table4.PNG?raw=true)  |


- The data is uniform
-- Can visually assess the uniformity of the data by looking at the histogram graphs, adjusting the incremement in the x-axis does not affect the general pattern of the data - it is uniform
-- Can statistically assess the uniformity of the data by examining the results of Kolmogorov test presented in tables 3 and 4

###### Step B
- Decreased N from 100,000
	-- *N* = 1000

| Table 5. Descriptive Statistics |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table5.PNG?raw=true)  |

- Decreasing N does not seem to affect the output when analyzed using the methods detailed in the 'Step A' section
- Figures 4 and 5 present histograms of the output when *N* = 1000

| Figure 4. Pseudo-Random Number Generators  |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/randomN-1000.PNG?raw=true)  |


| Figure 5. Quasi-Random Number Generator  |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/sobolN-1000.PNG?raw=true)  |

- Figure 6 is the histogram for Mersenne Twister and Knuth-B when *N* = 500


| Figure 6. Pseudo-Random Number Generators  |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/randomN-500.PNG?raw=true)  |

- One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results provide evidence that the distribution of each engine output is a uniform distribution

| Table 6. Testing for Distribution - Normal and Uniform |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table6.PNG?raw=true)  |


###### Step C
* Selected random engine: Mersenne Twister
* Selected distributions: Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Uniform (Real), Uniform (Integer)
-- Descriptive statistics found in table 7 and histograms in figure 7
-- Minimum and maximum values in addition to standard deviation are very different for the Normal, Poisson, and Binomial distributions relative to the two Uniform distributions
-- Means are similiar across the five distributions

## Part 2 - Snakes and Ladders (Discrete Event Markov Chains and Monte Carlo Simulations) (30 pts)

###### Step A
- Complete - see *TransitionMatrix.h*

###### Step B
###### B1 Markov Chain
* **(1) Markov Chain** (For this part (1) use the *Markov project* in the Snake and Ladders starter code): The game can be analyzed with a row vector, *v* with 101 components, representing the probabilities that the player is on each of the positions. V(0) is (1,0,0,...,0) since we know we start at square 0. v evolves by: <BR>![](images/prob.png?raw=true)<BR>
> Produce graphs, show how game evolves over time
> Plot useful stats such as:
> * percentage chance of finishing the game in n-moves
> * cumulative probability of finishing game in n-moves (cdf?)
> * other ways to convey useful info about results (modal number of moves required by single player to finish)

###### B2 Monte Carlo
* **(2) Monte Carlo**: he will will use a monte carlo process to solve our Discrete Time Markov Chains. Here (2) use the DTMC project, and utilize the DTMC method similar to what we did in class.
> Produce graphs, show how game evolves over time
> Plot useful stats such as:
> * percentage chance of finishing the game in n-moves
> * cumulative probability of finishing game in n-moves (cdf?)
> * other ways to convey useful info about results

* **(c) Simulate and analyze the results of Snakes and Ladders -10pts:**  Construct a new transition matrix based on the table:

Ladders From  | Ladders To | |  Snakes From  | Snakes To 
-------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- 
3|19| |11|7
15|37| |18|13
22|42| |28|12
25|64| |36|34
41|73| |77|16
53|74| |47|26
63|86| |83|39
76|91| |92|75
84|98| |99|70

>Run the same simulation and analyze your results similar to part (b) for the proper game of *Snakes and Ladders* for >both methods. How often are the snakes and ladders used, how do the probability of finishing change, etc? What is the >maximum and expected amount of moves for the game? Use charts and graphs to illustrate these points.

* **(d) Think - 0pts:** If these games are built entirely on chance, do they require any strategy? Is it really a *game*, would you rather play games of chance or games of strategy?
