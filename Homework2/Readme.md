## Part 1: Empirical Tests of Randomness (20 pts).
###### Step A
- Random number engines: Mersenne Twister, Knuth-B, Minimal Standard, Ranlux, and Sobol
- Raw output of the engines is stored in file *HW2_Part1_StepA.xlsx* (raw results sheet) in the Homework 2 folder
- Descriptive statistics for each engine are provided in table 1

| Table 1. Descriptive Statistics |
| ------------- |

- Random number engine ouput included aggregated data, specifically counts of the discrete values generated by each engine
- This frequency data was used to construct histograms with x-axis bins in incremements of 10 (figures 1 and 2)
-- Incremements of 10 was a relatively arbitrary choice. The incremement amount used for the bins was inconsequential to the shape of the histogram as illustrated in figure 3.
- Looking at the histograms we can see that all of the values were (for the most part) equally, or **uniformly**, sampled

- Spearman's correlation was run to assess the relationship between the engines' raw output
- Very weak correlation between each engine output (e.g., Mersenne & Minimal Standard, *r*~s~ = -.003,) and they failed to reach significance...
- ...except for one of the correlations...accidentally included output from a sixth random number engine, default random engine, in my analyses
-- Weak negative correlation between Ranlux and Default was statistically significant (*r*~s~ = -.008, *p* = .008)

| Table 2. Spearman's Correlation |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table2.PNG?raw=true)  |

- Ran two one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to assess the distribution of each engine output
- Looking at the last row of table 3, the p-value for each engine is significant
-- The engine outputs **do not** have an approximate normal distribution (Lee, Famoye, Shelden, & Brown, n.d.)

| Table 3. Testing for Distribution - Normal Distribution |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table3.PNG?raw=true)  |

- Conversely, the p-values in the uniform distribution table fail to reach significance
-- So we **can not** say that the data **does not** have a uniform distribution

| Table 4. Testing for Distribution - Uniform Distribution |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table4.PNG?raw=true)  |


- The data is uniform
-- Can visually assess the uniformity of the data by looking at the histogram graphs, adjusting the incremement in the x-axis does not affect the general pattern of the data - it is uniform
-- Can statistically assess the uniformity of the data by examining the results of Kolmogorov test presented in tables 3 and 4

###### Step B
- Decreased N from 100,000
	-- *N* = 1000

| Table 5. Descriptive Statistics |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table5.PNG?raw=true)  |

- Decreasing N does not seem to affect the output when analyzed using the methods detailed in the 'Step A' section
- Figures 4 and 5 present histograms of the output when *N* = 1000

| Figure 4. Pseudo-Random Number Generators  |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/randomN-1000.PNG?raw=true)  |


| Figure 5. Quasi-Random Number Generator  |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/sobolN-1000.PNG?raw=true)  |

- Figure 6 is the histogram for Mersenne Twister and Knuth-B when *N* = 500


| Figure 6. Pseudo-Random Number Generators  |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/randomN-500.PNG?raw=true)  |

- One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results provide evidence that the distribution of each engine output is a uniform distribution

| Table 6. Testing for Distribution - Normal and Uniform |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/table6.PNG?raw=true)  |


###### Step C
* Selected random engine: Mersenne Twister
* Selected distributions: Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Uniform (Real), Uniform (Integer)
-- Descriptive statistics found in table 7 and histograms in figure 7
-- Minimum and maximum values in addition to standard deviation are very different for the Normal, Poisson, and Binomial distributions relative to the two Uniform distributions
-- Means are similiar across the five distributions
